# Personal-Website

This code is for my personal website. My personal website acts as a hub/portfolio for all my projects. 
It is a simple HTML, CSS and JS website with no backend, though some of the projects it links to do have backend systems.

I created this using custom CSS as well as come code pen JS and CSS effects. That said 90% of the website was coded
all on my own with no frameworks or assest bundles used, even the resizing and mobile friendliness was all made by me.
